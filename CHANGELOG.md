# 1.3.0

- Reset to left positioning: When disabling falemos using macros, it resets the camera dock to left, to avoid the 100px limit set by falemos, as a workaround since I am not able to reset it back to 240px
- Updated to v11 compatibility
- Updated Vaccinator macro: now allows to resize window
- Modified nofit mode: now it wont reset scene adjust to fit to width/height when there are no changes to mode
